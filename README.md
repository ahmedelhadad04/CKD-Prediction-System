# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning–based decision support system for early detection and risk assessment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using clinical patient data.

## Project Overview
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection using LASSO
- Multiple ML models trained and compared
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Explainable AI using SHAP
- Interactive Gradio interface for predictions

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- File: kidney_disease.csv
- 400 patient records with clinical features

## Best Model
- Support Vector Machine (RBF)
- High accuracy and recall on CKD detection

## How to Run
1. Open `CKD.ipynb`
2. Upload `kidney_disease.csv` when prompted
3. Run all cells from top to bottom
